        With the fast advancement of lending technology and data availability, what is the role of human underwriting in augmentation of algorithmic underwriting systems? We study the effects of an FHA policy that relaxed the requirement for human underwriting for low-credit-score, high-leverage borrowers. Estimating the bunching of loans around the DTI threshold, we find that the policy change leads to a significant credit expansion to affected borrowers, represented by higher mortgage take-up and increased household leverage. Such effects are more pronounced among non-Hispanic White borrowers and higher-income borrowers. Consequently, low-credit-score households are more likely to move to better school districts. Despite the credit expansion, we find little change in default risks or interest rates among the affected group. A structural approach helps us quantify the welfare implications of the policy change and isolate the credit supply channel. Overall, our results suggest that the human underwriting mandate restricted credit supply without substantially reducing risks. However, a heavier reliance on machine underwriting can generate disparate impact across racial groups and along the income distribution.

  abstract: >
        I use a structural model to quantify the cross-subsidization in the US mortgage market due to heterogeneous borrower refinancing tendencies. In equilibrium, the presence of borrowers with high refinancing inertia reduces mortgage interest rates, particularly on lower upfront closing cost mortgages which have more valuable refinancing options. As a result, actively refinancing borrowers refinance excessively relative to a perfect information, no cross-subsidization benchmark, an effect that accounts for 36% of the rate and term refinances for 2013--2019 new purchase originations and generates deadweight losses due to administrative resource costs. Alternative contract designs can reduce transfers and increase total welfare.

        How should researchers test for differences in the menus of options that people face when given data on choices? In mortgage and labor contexts, we show how intuitively appealing regression-based approaches for assessing differences in menus can lead to misleading and contradictory results. To address this issue, we use pairwise dominance relationships in choices that can be supplemented by restrictions on the range of plausible menus to define (1) a test statistic for equality in menus and (2) a difference in menus (DIM) metric. We also derive a new procedure for inference on our class of problems. Finally, we apply our methodology to a novel data set linking 2018--2019 Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) data to Optimal Blue rate locks. We find evidence for mortgage menu differences by race, particularly among Conforming mortgage borrowers who are relatively creditworthy.

- title: "The Cost of Banking Deserts: Racial Disparities in Access to PPP Lenders and their Implications"
  pdflink: "/pdf/geographyppp.pdf"

    Many government support programs for small businesses are designed to pass through banks and credit unions. However, this poses barriers for minority communities that are less connected to financial institutions for obtaining this support. Using the latest program for supporting small businesses, the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP), as an example, we show that there was a large disparity in the density of PPP enrolled lenders by racial composition of the neighborhood. This difference is both due to a lower density of lenders in those neighborhoods in general, and by the fact that the banks and credit unions that do operate there are smaller, are less likely to have previous relationships with the Small Business Administration, and are less likely to enroll in the program. More heavily Black neighborhoods have significantly lower take-up of PPP loans particularly in lower population (more rural) areas where this disparity is most salient. Through an instrumental variables analysis, we show that the intensive margin of access to enrolled lenders can explain about 35% of the racial disparity in take up within the relevant areas. Our results suggest that government programs that provide "support through banks" can have undesirable distributional implications.

    We examine whether law school alumni relationships between lawyers and judges affect case outcomes. We show that, in the context of medical malpractice lawsuits filed in Florida, having a plaintiff's attorney who attended the same law school as a randomly assigned judge increases the chances of recovery by 2%. We further show that the effect is more pronounced between lawyers and judges with a larger age gap, consistent with a mentorship hypothesis rather than a personal relationship effect from lawyers and judges who overlapped in school. Our results show that law school networks can influence case outcomes.

- title: "Semi-Parametric Estimation of Counterfactuals in Dynamic Discrete Choice Models"
  pdflink: "https://davidzhang.scholar.harvard.edu/files/dhz/files/semidynamics.pdf"
  abstract: >
      I develop a new method for estimating counterfactuals in dynamic discrete choice models, a widely used set of models in economics, without requiring a distributional assumption on utility shocks. Applying my method to the canonical Rust (1987) setting, I find that the typical logit assumption on utility shocks can lead the researcher to conclude that the agent's counterfactual choice probabilities are much more sensitive to policy changes than what a semi-parametric model would suggest. Therefore, my method may be useful to applied researchers in generating policy counterfactuals that are robust to such distributional assumptions.
