- title: "Is There a Puzzle in Underwater Mortgage Default?"

  coauthors: "Lara Loewenstein and Paul Willen and Yuxi Yao"
  abstract: >
         A recurring question in the mortgage default literature is why underwater default is rare relative to model predictions. We find that one answer is miscalibration of flow payoffs. We build a novel, detailed quantitative model of mortgage default and find that realistic rent dynamics plus mild levels of default costs are sufficient to eliminate negative-equity strategic default. We present further empirical results supporting our model’s focus on flow payoffs. Our model addresses the underwater mortgage default puzzle, offers more realistic interpretations of policy consequences, and reinforces the theoretical effectiveness of cash-flow-based interventions.

  abstract: >
         We empirically examine the effects of the 2024 National Association of Realtors (NAR) settlement on the market for real estate intermediation and document four main findings. First, following the settlement, buyers became two percentage points more likely to forgo formal representation, an effect concentrated in states without prior Buyer's Representation Agreement (BRA) requirements. Second, commission rates show no significant change. Third, the market share of FinTech and discount brokerages remains low. Fourth, transactions increasingly involve seller and buyer agents with higher past volumes and greater experience. Overall, the NAR settlement had only a modest impact on the $180 billion annual volume of real estate commissions.

- title: "The Distributional Effects of GSE Pricing on Home Purchases"
  pdflink: "https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=5222560"
  coauthors: "You Suk Kim and Feng Liu"
  abstract: >
         The guarantee fee (g-fee) pricing of government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs) plays an important role in distributing credit. We study the distributional effects of g-fee pricing on relative home purchase volumes using a stacked differences-in-differences design based on recent g-fee adjustments. We find large elasticities of relative home purchase volume to g-fee pricing, consistent with a calibrated model of frictional housing search. Furthermore, the elasticities are larger (smaller) for higher income borrowers among the subsidized (subsidizing) credit score groups. Overall, our results suggest that g-fee pricing has large distributional effects on home purchases that may be regressive in the income dimension.

- title: "Mortgage Lock-in, Lifecycle Migration, and the Welfare Effects of Housing Market Liquidity"
  pdflink: "https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4933879"
  coauthors: "Kristopher Gerardi and Franklin Qian"
  abstract: >
         We use a search and matching model to study the heterogeneous welfare effects of housing market illiquidity due to mortgage lock-in over the lifecycle. We find that younger home buyers are disproportionately affected by mortgage lock-in, which disrupts their typical pattern of moving to higher-quality neighborhoods. We estimate a model with heterogeneous seller-buyers bargaining within markets defined by CBSA-income terciles and with endogenous migration across markets. We find that the effects of mortgage lock-in on volume is significantly more muted than its partial equilibrium estimates, with interest rates driving most of the aggregate decline in volume, and with the level and sign of effect varying greatly across geographies. Without mortgage lock-in, time on the market increases by 80–109%, house prices decline by 2%–4%, and match surplus increases by 0%–5%. The pricing and match surplus effects are 2–3 times larger for households in lower-income areas, due to a higher idiosyncratic dispersion in buyer valuation leading to larger match surplus variation in those areas. Our study highlights the welfare benefits of market thickness in real estate markets.

- title: "Small Mortgages and the Rise of FinTech and Shadow Banks"
  pdflink: "https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4682458"
  coauthors: "Yongqiang Chu and Tim Zhang"
  abstract: >
        The growth of FinTech and shadow banks could have unexpected spillover effects on bank lending. We study this possibility in the context of small mortgages, which are low balance mortgages disproportionately originated by brick-and-mortar banks and retained in their portfolios. Using a shift-share instrument after the introduction of Basel III, we find that areas more exposed to FinTech and shadow bank growth have significantly higher small mortgage denial rates despite similar application quality and local economic trends. We also find a corresponding reduction in small mortgage originations as well as lower owner occupancy shares among originated small mortgages. Further analyses suggest that reduced CRA requirements and shifts in bank business models as causal mechanisms. Overall, our results suggest that the rise of FinTech and shadow banks plays a key role in the declining availability of small mortgages, potentially contributing to lower homeownership rates among less affluent households.

  abstract: >
        We study the effects of a policy that increased reliance on algorithmic underwriting for low-credit-score, high-leverage mortgage borrowers. Using a bunching-based approach, we document a large policy-induced credit expansion among affected borrowers, with little changes in default risks given observables. The credit expansion is larger among White, Hispanic, and higher-income borrowers. Post-policy, low-credit-score individuals are more likely to move to better-rated school districts. A structural approach helps quantify the welfare implications of the policy. Our results suggest a limited role of human discretion for most borrowers in this market and highlight challenges in increasing financial inclusion for certain disadvantaged populations.

- title: "Closing Costs, Refinancing, and Inefficiencies in the Mortgage Market (Job Market Paper)"
  pdflink: "/pdf/zhang_jmp.pdf"
  abstract: >
        I use a structural model to quantify the cross-subsidization in the US mortgage market due to heterogeneous borrower refinancing tendencies. In equilibrium, the presence of borrowers with high refinancing inertia reduces mortgage interest rates, particularly on lower upfront closing cost mortgages which have more valuable refinancing options. As a result, actively refinancing borrowers refinance excessively relative to a perfect information, no cross-subsidization benchmark, an effect that accounts for 36% of the rate and term refinances for 2013--2019 new purchase originations and generates deadweight losses due to administrative resource costs. Alternative contract designs can reduce transfers and increase total welfare.

  abstract: >
        How should researchers test for differences in the menus of options that people face when given data on choices? In mortgage and labor contexts, we show how intuitively appealing regression-based approaches for assessing differences in menus can lead to misleading and contradictory results. To address this issue, we use pairwise dominance relationships in choices that can be supplemented by restrictions on the range of plausible menus to define (1) a test statistic for equality in menus and (2) a difference in menus (DIM) metric. We also derive a new procedure for inference on our class of problems. Finally, we apply our methodology to a novel data set linking 2018--2019 Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) data to Optimal Blue rate locks. We find evidence for mortgage menu differences by race, particularly among Conforming mortgage borrowers who are relatively creditworthy.

- title: "The Cost of Banking Deserts: Racial Disparities in Access to PPP Lenders and their Implications"
  pdflink: "/pdf/geographyppp.pdf"
  coauthors: "Jeffrey Wang"
  abstract: >
    Many government support programs for small businesses are designed to pass through banks and credit unions. However, this poses barriers for minority communities that are less connected to financial institutions for obtaining this support. Using the latest program for supporting small businesses, the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP), as an example, we show that there was a large disparity in the density of PPP enrolled lenders by racial composition of the neighborhood. This difference is both due to a lower density of lenders in those neighborhoods in general, and by the fact that the banks and credit unions that do operate there are smaller, are less likely to have previous relationships with the Small Business Administration, and are less likely to enroll in the program. More heavily Black neighborhoods have significantly lower take-up of PPP loans particularly in lower population (more rural) areas where this disparity is most salient. Through an instrumental variables analysis, we show that the intensive margin of access to enrolled lenders can explain about 35% of the racial disparity in take up within the relevant areas. Our results suggest that government programs that provide "support through banks" can have undesirable distributional implications.

  abstract: >
    We examine whether law school alumni relationships between lawyers and judges is correlated with case outcomes. We show that, in the context of medical malpractice lawsuits filed in Florida, having a plaintiff's attorney who attended the same law school as a randomly assigned judge increases the chances of recovery by about 2 percentage points. We further show that the effect is more pronounced between lawyers and judges with a larger age gap, consistent with an age-dependent effect rather than a personal relationship effect from lawyers and judges who overlapped in school. Our results suggest that case outcomes can be biased when lawyers and judges are part of the same affinity groups.

- title: "Semi-Parametric Estimation of Counterfactuals in Dynamic Discrete Choice Models"
  pdflink: "/pdf/ddc.pdf"
  abstract: >
      I develop a new method for estimating counterfactuals in dynamic discrete choice models, a widely used set of models in economics, without requiring a distributional assumption on utility shocks. Applying my method to the canonical Rust (1987) setting, I find that the typical logit assumption on utility shocks can lead the researcher to conclude that the agent's counterfactual choice probabilities are much more sensitive to policy changes than what a semi-parametric model would suggest. Therefore, my method may be useful to applied researchers in generating policy counterfactuals that are robust to such distributional assumptions.
