  abstract: >
    We examine whether law school alumni relationships between lawyers and judges affect case outcomes. We show that, in the context of medical malpractice lawsuits filed in Florida, having a plaintiff's attorney who attended the same law school as a randomly assigned judge increases the chances of recovery by 2%. We further show that the effect is more pronounced between lawyers and judges with a larger age gap, consistent with a mentorship hypothesis rather than a personal relationship effect from lawyers and judges who overlapped in school. Our results show that law school networks can influence case outcomes.

- title: "Semi-Parametric Estimation of Counterfactuals in Dynamic Discrete Choice Models"

  abstract: >
      I develop a new method for estimating counterfactuals in dynamic discrete choice models, a widely used set of models in economics, without requiring a distributional assumption on utility shocks. Applying my method to the canonical Rust (1987) setting, I find that the typical logit assumption on utility shocks can lead the researcher to conclude that the agent's counterfactual choice probabilities are much more sensitive to policy changes than what a semi-parametric model would suggest. Therefore, my method may be useful to applied researchers in generating policy counterfactuals that are robust to such distributional assumptions.
